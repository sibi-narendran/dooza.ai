An AI employee shows up, does the work, and moves to the next task - whether you're watching or not.

            { question: "Can I build a business on OpenClaw?", answer: "Yes, but OpenClaw is an agent runtime, not a business platform. You'll need to solve multi-tenancy, security, cron scheduling, UI workspaces, and billing yourself. Alternatively, platforms like Dooza solve these 7 infrastructure problems so you can focus on building the AI employee's brain." },

            { question: "What is multi-tenancy and why does it matter?", answer: "Multi-tenancy means one server running AI employees for many customers with total data isolation. Without it, you'd need one server per customer, which means costs scale linearly and margins die." },
            { question: "Why do AI employees need cron scheduling?", answer: "Without cron, your agent only works when a human talks to it - that's an assistant worth $20/month. With cron, your agent wakes up autonomously, generates content, monitors reviews, and sends reports - that's an employee worth $50-200/month." },

            { question: "Can an AI receptionist handle complex conversations?", answer: "Modern AI receptionists like Rachel use natural language processing to handle multi-turn conversations, answer FAQs, qualify leads with custom questions, and know when to route to a human for complex issues." },

With 85% of callers refusing to leave voicemail, that means most businesses lose over half their inbound leads before ever speaking to them." }

Unlike AI tools that wait for prompts, AI employees work autonomously on schedules." },
            { question: "How much does AI staffing cost compared to hiring?", answer: "Traditional hiring costs $4,700 per hire plus $3,500-6,000/month per employee in salary alone.

Humans should focus on the 20% requiring judgment, creativity, and relationship building. The best model is a hybrid workforce." },

            { question: "Can an AI sales agent really qualify leads as well as a human?", answer: "For initial qualification, yes — often better.

            { question: "How much does an AI sales agent cost compared to hiring an SDR?", answer: "A human SDR costs $4,000-$7,000/month in base salary alone, plus commission, benefits, and management overhead.

            { question: "Will prospects know they're talking to an AI?", answer: "Modern AI sales agents use natural language that's conversational and professional. Most prospects can't tell the difference during initial qualification. The AI identifies itself transparently when asked, and hands off to a human for complex negotiations." },
            { question: "What industries benefit most from AI sales agents?", answer: "Any business with high lead volume and a qualifying process benefits: real estate, insurance, SaaS, home services, financial services, and professional services. If you're losing deals because of slow follow-up or inconsistent qualification, an AI sales agent will help." },

It connects to AI models like Claude or GPT and can automate tasks through messaging apps. It's powerful but requires significant technical expertise to set up and maintain." },
            { question: "Is OpenClaw free?", answer: "The framework is free and open-source. However, running it requires API costs ($100-300+/day for heavy use), a dedicated server, and significant developer time for setup and maintenance. The 'free' software often costs more than a managed platform." },
            { question: "Why is Dooza better than building on OpenClaw?", answer: "Dooza solves the 7 infrastructure problems that OpenClaw doesn't: multi-tenancy, workstation UIs, real-time chat, cron scheduling, prebuilt skills, memory management, and security. You get all of this for $29/month instead of spending weeks building it yourself." },
            { question: "Can I use OpenClaw for business?", answer: "You can, but OpenClaw is an agent runtime, not a business platform. You'll need to build multi-tenancy, security layers, user management, billing, and a UI from scratch. Most businesses are better served by a managed platform like Dooza." },
            { question: "How much developer time does OpenClaw require?", answer: "Based on real-world builds: 2-4 weeks for basic setup, 2-3 months for production infrastructure (multi-tenancy, security, cron), and ongoing maintenance. At $150/hour developer rates, that's $50,000-100,000+ before your first customer." },

Dooza is built on OpenClaw's open-source framework and adds all the managed infrastructure businesses need — multi-tenancy, security, cron scheduling, billing, and a dashboard UI.

            { question: "Will using an AI agent get my LinkedIn account banned?", answer: "Not if done correctly. AI agents that operate through official APIs, respect rate limits, and mimic human behavior patterns stay compliant. The key is personalization over volume — quality outreach, not spam." },
            { question: "How is an AI agent different from LinkedIn automation tools?", answer: "Traditional automation tools send templated messages at scale using browser automation, which LinkedIn detects and bans. AI agents use intelligent personalization, respect platform limits, and can operate through API-compliant channels like email follow-ups after initial LinkedIn connections." },
            { question: "What response rates can I expect from AI-powered LinkedIn outreach?", answer: "AI-personalized outreach typically sees 15-25% response rates compared to 5-10% for templated automation. The key is that AI reads each prospect's profile and crafts genuinely relevant messages." },
            { question: "How many connection requests can I safely send per day?", answer: "LinkedIn's safe zone is 20-25 connection requests per day for established accounts. AI agents work within these limits while maximizing quality — making each request count rather than blasting volume." },
            { question: "Can AI agents handle the entire LinkedIn sales process?", answer: "AI agents handle prospecting, initial outreach, and follow-up conversations. When a prospect shows buying intent, the AI hands off to your human sales team for relationship building and closing." },
            { question: "How does Dooza handle LinkedIn lead generation?", answer: "Dooza's Stan (AI Lead Generator) identifies ideal prospects, crafts personalized outreach, manages follow-up sequences, and qualifies leads before handing them to your sales team — all while staying within LinkedIn's guidelines." },
            { question: "How long does it take to see results from AI LinkedIn outreach?", answer: "Most businesses see their first qualified leads within 1-2 weeks. Pipeline impact becomes significant within 30-60 days as the AI optimizes messaging based on response patterns." }

        faqData: [
            { question: "How much revenue am I losing from missed calls?", answer: "The average small business misses 62% of inbound calls. With 85% of callers refusing to leave voicemail, you're losing over half your potential customers. For a business receiving 20 calls/day at $200 average value, that's $12,000+/month in lost revenue." },
            { question: "How is an AI voice agent different from an AI receptionist?", answer: "An AI receptionist answers and routes calls. An AI voice agent goes further — it qualifies leads with custom questions, captures contact details, pushes data to your CRM, and triggers automated follow-up sequences. It's a revenue capture tool, not just an answering service." },
            { question: "Can an AI voice agent integrate with my CRM?", answer: "Yes. Dooza's voice agent pushes caller data, qualification answers, and call summaries directly to your CRM. Every missed call becomes a lead record with full context — no manual data entry." },
            { question: "What happens during after-hours calls?", answer: "The AI voice agent answers 24/7 with the same quality as business hours. It qualifies the caller, captures their needs, books appointments on your calendar, and sends you a text summary. 40% of inbound calls happen outside business hours — you're capturing all of them." },
            { question: "Will callers know they're speaking to an AI?", answer: "Modern AI voice agents use natural, conversational language that sounds professional and human-like. Most callers can't tell the difference. The agent introduces itself by name and maintains context throughout the call." },
            { question: "How fast is the setup?", answer: "Most businesses are live within 30 minutes. During your free onboarding call, our team configures the voice agent with your business info, qualification questions, FAQs, and CRM integration." },
            { question: "What's the ROI of an AI voice agent?", answer: "If you capture just 5 additional leads per month that would have gone to voicemail, and your average deal value is $500, that's $2,500/month in recovered revenue — an 86x return on a $29/month investment." }

        slug: 'automate-employee-performance-reviews',
        faqData: [
            { question: "Can AI really write fair performance reviews?", answer: "AI drafts reviews based on objective data — project completions, peer feedback, metrics, and documented contributions. This removes the recency bias, halo effect, and subjective favoritism that plague manual reviews. The manager still reviews and personalizes the final draft." },
            { question: "Will employees trust AI-generated reviews?", answer: "Transparency is key. When employees see that reviews are based on documented data rather than a manager's memory of the last 2 weeks, trust actually increases. Studies show employees prefer data-backed feedback over subjective opinions." },
            { question: "How much time does AI save on performance reviews?", answer: "Managers typically spend 17+ hours per review cycle. AI reduces this to 2-3 hours by automating data collection, first-draft writing, and bias checking. That's 10+ hours saved per quarter per manager." },
            { question: "Does AI eliminate bias in performance reviews?", answer: "AI significantly reduces bias by basing reviews on objective data. It can flag language patterns associated with gender, racial, or age bias. However, human oversight is still essential — AI is a tool to reduce bias, not eliminate the need for judgment." },
            { question: "What data does AI use to write performance reviews?", answer: "AI aggregates project completion rates, peer feedback, self-assessments, communication metrics, goal progress, and documented achievements. It creates a comprehensive picture rather than relying on a manager's selective memory." },
            { question: "Is AI performance review software expensive?", answer: "Dedicated HR AI tools cost $5-15 per employee per month. For small businesses, Dooza's AI employees can help draft reviews and analyze performance data as part of the $29/month plan." },
            { question: "How do I get started with AI performance reviews?", answer: "Start by digitizing your review criteria and collecting data consistently. Use AI to draft initial reviews, then have managers refine and personalize them. Most teams see immediate time savings in their first review cycle." }

        faqData: [
            { question: "What is an AI legal assistant for law firms?", answer: "An AI legal assistant is software that handles client intake calls — answering the phone 24/7, screening potential cases by practice area, gathering key facts, scheduling consultations, and following up with leads. It performs the administrative work of intake, not legal advice." },
            { question: "Is an AI legal assistant practicing law or violating ethics rules?", answer: "No. An AI legal assistant handles administrative intake tasks — the same work a receptionist or intake coordinator does. It doesn't give legal advice, interpret statutes, or recommend legal strategies. It screens, schedules, and gathers facts. Bar associations distinguish clearly between administrative support and the practice of law." },
            { question: "How much does an AI legal assistant cost compared to a paralegal?", answer: "A paralegal or intake coordinator costs $3,500-5,500/month in salary alone, plus benefits. A legal answering service runs $500-1,500/month with limited hours. Dooza's Rachel costs $29/month — 24/7, unlimited calls, with law-firm-specific configuration." },
            { question: "Can the AI screen cases by practice area?", answer: "Yes. Rachel is configured with your firm's practice areas and screening criteria. She asks the right questions for PI, family law, criminal defense, estate planning, and more — then classifies urgency and routes to the appropriate attorney." },
            { question: "Does the AI disclose that it's not a human attorney?", answer: "Absolutely. Rachel introduces herself by name and is transparent about being an AI assistant when asked. She never represents herself as an attorney and clearly communicates that she's helping with scheduling and intake, not providing legal advice." },
            { question: "What happens when someone calls after hours?", answer: "Rachel answers 24/7 with the same quality as business hours. She screens the case, gathers facts, assesses urgency, and either books a next-day consultation or escalates urgent matters to the on-call attorney. 60%+ of legal intake calls happen outside business hours." }
