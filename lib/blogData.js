An AI employee shows up, does the work, and moves to the next task - whether you're watching or not. Businesses have budgets for employees ($4,000-6,000/month for a social media manager), making AI employees worth 100x more than AI tools." },
            { question: "Can I build a business on OpenClaw?", answer: "Yes, but OpenClaw is an agent runtime, not a business platform. You'll need to solve multi-tenancy, security, cron scheduling, UI workspaces, and billing yourself. Alternatively, platforms like Dooza solve these 7 infrastructure problems so you can focus on building the AI employee's brain." },
            { question: "How much does it cost to run an AI employee platform?", answer: "With OpenClaw's open-source framework, total infrastructure can run under $15/month serving hundreds of customers. Compare this to funded AI startups spending $30-50K/month on infrastructure." },
            { question: "What is multi-tenancy and why does it matter?", answer: "Multi-tenancy means one server running AI employees for many customers with total data isolation. Without it, you'd need one server per customer, which means costs scale linearly and margins die." },
            { question: "Why do AI employees need cron scheduling?", answer: "Without cron, your agent only works when a human talks to it - that's an assistant worth $20/month. With cron, your agent wakes up autonomously, generates content, monitors reviews, and sends reports - that's an employee worth $50-200/month." },
            { question: "How does Dooza's marketplace work?", answer: "Dooza is opening a marketplace where anyone can build and publish AI employees. Define the personality in SOUL.md, write instructions in AGENTS.md, add YAML tools. Dooza handles tenancy, auth, billing, and deployment." },
            { question: "Is it safe to give AI employees access to business data?", answer: "Only with proper security layers. Dooza uses three layers: agent-level whitelists, global blacklists (no system commands), and sandbox isolation (each customer's agents access only their own directory). All active by default." }
